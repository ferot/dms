Distributed Monitoring System

Aim of project is to create system with ability to track objects with mapping their position into real coordinates.
System as design is able to run on distributed devices which cooperate to gain more efficiency and accuracy in tracking than in using just single device.

Features :
-ability to detect and track variety* of objects
-easy to run : just plug cam and run app
-calibration tool to allow 'train' system in specific room
-cross-platform code with script allowing to prepare environment 

Setup:
1.git clone https://github.com/ferot/dms/edit/master
2.execute (needed root privigiles): sudo ./prepenv
3.mkdir build && cd build
4.make -j<NUM_OF_CORES>
5.cd bin && ./core_app
when generated

*user if wants to track any desired object has to provide it's own classifier xml file generated by OpenCV tools, or use prepared ones.
